            <h2>How the Internet Became My Tech University</h2><br>
             <img src="internet-uni.png" alt="post image"><br><br>
             <p>
                When people talk about tech, they often imagine expensive bootcamps, Silicon Valley, and high-end laptops. But my journey into tech didn‚Äôt start in a university lecture hall. It started in my small room with an old laptop, limited data, and an endless hunger to learn. <br><br>
                For me, the internet became my university. <br><br>
                It became the place where I found knowledge, inspiration, challenges, and growth. In this post, I want to walk you through how the internet shaped my tech journey ‚Äî and how it can do the same for you, even if you‚Äôre starting with almost nothing.
             </p> <br><br>

                <span style="font-weight: 700;">The Beginning: Zero Background, Just Curiosity</span> <br><br>
                I wasn‚Äôt born with a tech-savvy background. I didn‚Äôt know how to code, design, or build anything digital. All I had was curiosity. And curiosity, when partnered with Google and YouTube, became my gateway into a whole new world. <br><br>
                I started typing questions like:
                <ul>
                    <li>‚ÄúHow to learn HTML and CSS for free?‚Äù</li> <br>
                    <li>‚ÄúWhat is programming?‚Äù</li> <br>
                    <li>‚ÄúBest free coding websites for beginners‚Äù</li>
                </ul>
                And just like that, the rabbit hole opened. <br><br>
              What amazed me was how freely accessible valuable knowledge was. I realized that many of the people working at top companies had once watched the same videos, read the same articles, and practiced with the same free tools I now had access to.
             </p> <br><br>
             <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">Free Platforms That Taught Me Like a University Would</span> <br><br>
                Here‚Äôs how the internet became my university, broken down into the tools and platforms that shaped me: <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">1. YouTube, My Visual Classroom</span> <br><br>
                I learned by watching others do it. YouTube creators broke complex topics into understandable chunks. Whether it was HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or UI/UX design, there was always someone breaking it down for free. Channels like Traversy Media, The Net Ninja, and Kevin Powell made learning feel exciting. <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">2. FreeCodeCamp, My Course Curriculum</span> <br><br>
                If YouTube was my classroom, FreeCodeCamp was my structured curriculum. With thousands of coding lessons, projects, and certifications, I got the discipline of a structured program, without paying a dime. <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Google, My Personal Lecturer</span> <br><br>
                Whenever I got stuck, I didn‚Äôt run to a lecturer, I Googled. Stack Overflow, Medium, Reddit, and forums became places where real developers gave real answers. Google taught me how to think like a developer: search, try, fail, and try again. <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">4. GitHub, My Portfolio Repository</span> <br><br>
                I didn‚Äôt wait until I was an expert. I started uploading my code to GitHub early. It taught me how to manage projects, track progress, and share my growth publicly ‚Äî just like students showcase projects in school. <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">5. Twitter and LinkedIn, My Tech Community </span>
                I began following developers, designers, and tech influencers. Their stories encouraged me. Their posts taught me. Their journeys proved that I wasn‚Äôt behind ‚Äî I was just beginning.
             </p>
             <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">Challenges I Faced in My Online Tech University</span> <br><br>
                Let me be real ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt easy. Sometimes, the tutorials were confusing. My laptop would freeze. My data would finish. I‚Äôd feel like I wasn‚Äôt smart enough. But I kept going. <br><br>
                Here‚Äôs what helped me:
                <ul>
                    <li>Daily discipline, not motivation.</li> <br>
                    <li>Repetition, watching tutorials over and over until it clicked.</li> <br>
                    <li>Asking questions, even if they seemed dumb.</li> <br>
                    <li>Working on small projects, applying what I was learning.</li>
                </ul>
                I failed a lot. But failure online is safe. There‚Äôs no one laughing at you. You just try again. And again. And again.
             </p> <br><br>

             <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">The Mindset Shift That Changed Everything</span> <br><br>
                One day it hit me, I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúlearning tech,‚Äù I was becoming someone different. More patient. More focused. More confident. <br><br>
                I realized that the internet wasn‚Äôt just giving me tech skills. It was changing my mindset. <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>It made me believe in lifelong learning.</li> <br><br>
                    <li>It helped me stop comparing and start growing.</li> <br><br>
                    <li>It taught me to solve problems, not just consume content.</li>
                </ul>
                And slowly, I began to see results. I built my first website. Then my first real project. Then I helped someone else. That‚Äôs when it clicked, this thing is real.
             </p>
             <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">What This Means for You</span> <br><br>
                If you‚Äôre reading this and feel like you don‚Äôt have the money, the degree, or the perfect laptop, let me tell you something:
                You don‚Äôt need perfect conditions to start learning tech. <br><br>
                You need: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Curiosity</li><br>
                    <li>Consistency</li> <br>
                    <li>WiFi (or borrowed data üòÖ)</li> <br>
                    <li>And the willingness to fail, learn, and repeat</li>
                </ul>
                The internet is your university. The classroom is open 24/7. The teachers are global. The resources are free. And the graduation is when you build something real.
             </p> <br><br>
             <p>
               <span style="font-weight: 700;">Final Thoughts: You Can Start Now</span> <br><br>
               I still have a long way to go in my tech journey. But I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come, and it all started with free tools and a hunger to grow. <br><br>
               If you're starting your tech journey today, don‚Äôt wait for perfect. Just start. Open your browser. Google something. Watch a video. Write your first line of code. The internet is waiting, and it might just become your university too.
