        <p> The wait is not punishment. It’s preparation.</p> <br><br>

        <p>
            Waiting seasons are strange. Sometimes they feel like stillness. Other times, like silence. But for me, it was both a space where nothing seemed to be moving fast enough, yet everything within me was shifting. I’ve come to understand something powerful: waiting isn’t a pause in purpose. It’s where purpose is forged. <br> <br>
            Whether you’re waiting for clarity, connection, provision, or purpose, here are ten lessons I’ve learned that shaped my life, my mindset, and my faith:
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Waiting Is Not Wasting</span> <br><br>
            Waiting is not inactivity. It’s training. In my waiting season, I didn’t have a camera, yet I studied photography. No laptop, yet I designed websites. I stayed hungry, even when I had little. That taught me: you don’t wait by doing nothing, you wait by preparing. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Delay Is Not Denial</span> <br><br>
            I’ve faced silence after sending messages. Opportunities I hoped for didn’t come. But every delay turned out to be protection or redirection. It taught me: if it’s not happening yet, it doesn’t mean it won’t. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> 3. Obedience Doesn’t Always Feel Like Progress</span> <br><br>
            There were seasons when I obeyed everything I believed God was saying, yet, things didn’t shift externally. But internally? I was growing roots. A vision I had in 2023 reminded me: what God shows you is real, even if the season doesn’t look like it yet. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;">4. Waiting Reveals Your Motives</span> <br><br>
            When applause fades and progress is slow, your why is tested. Are you building for impact or attention? Waiting purifies purpose. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> 5. Seeds Grow in the Dark</span> <br><br>
            Just because it’s invisible doesn’t mean it’s not working. Seeds grow in silence before sprouting. I kept blogging, building, and learning even when no one was clapping. That’s what made my roots deep. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;">6. Community Is Critical</span> <br><br>
            Sometimes, the right DM or encouragement from a stranger kept me going. God used people to sustain me. Your growth might feel lonely, but it doesn’t have to be isolated. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> 7. God Is Still Working</span> <br><br>
            Behind the scenes, hearts are aligning, paths are forming. Doors you didn’t know existed will open in time, sometimes suddenly. But they’re never truly sudden, they’re the result of quiet preparation. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> 8. Vision Is Sharpened in Stillness</span> <br><br>
            Waiting helped me see clearly. Not just dream. Not just rush. Stillness helps focus. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> 9. You’ll Be Grateful for the Delay</span> <br><br>
            Looking back, the things I didn’t get when I wanted them would’ve crushed me. I wasn’t ready. Waiting made me ready. <br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> 10. You’re Not Behind</span> <br><br>
            God doesn’t run by hustle culture timelines. You’re not late. You’re in alignment. Your process is sacred.
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Final Words</span> <br><br>
            You may feel like you’re in the dark, becoming, stretching, waiting. But trust this: you’re not stuck. You’re not invisible to God. And when the time is right, the version of you that emerges will be beyond who you were when you started. <br><br>
            Keep building. Keep believing. The wait is not wasted. <br><br>
