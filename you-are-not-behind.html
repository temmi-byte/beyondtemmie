        <h2>You Are Not Behind.</h2><br>
        <img src="behind.png" alt="post image"><br><br>
        <p>
            Have you ever paused to look at your life and felt this tight, painful pressure? The kind that whispers you’re too late, too slow, or too far behind others? Like everyone else has somehow figured it out except you? If you have, you’re not alone, but more importantly, you’re not behind. <br><br>
            In a world where timelines are broadcast 24/7 on social media, it’s easy to assume you’re falling short. You see people your age (or younger) hitting big milestones: launching startups, traveling the world, making six figures, buying their dream homes, getting married, having kids, and it makes you question everything about your own pace. But here’s the truth: your journey is not a race. It’s a story, and stories have different chapters.
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">The Danger of Timeline Comparison</span> <br><br>
            Most people feel behind because they’re comparing their Chapter 3 to someone else’s Chapter 20. But what you see is only the highlight, the success, not the struggle. You don’t see the sleepless nights, failures, or the quiet seasons when nothing seemed to work. Comparison robs you of gratitude, joy, and the beauty of your own unique growth. <br><br>
            Every seed has its season. The mango tree and the corn plant don’t sprout, grow, and bear fruit at the same time, but both are valuable. You may not be seeing visible fruit now, but that doesn’t mean nothing is happening. Underground, your roots may be deepening.
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">You Are Right on Time</span> <br><br>
            One of the most freeing truths you can carry is this: there’s no <span style="font-weight: 600;">“correct”</span> timeline for success. There’s only your time. Some people build momentum early. Others hit their stride much later in life. But both are valid. What matters most is that you don’t give up on your process just because someone else seems ahead. <br><br>
            Let’s be honest: growth takes time. Mastery takes time. Confidence takes time. Purpose unfolds in layers. If you feel like you're moving slowly, remind yourself that the most beautiful things in life aren’t rushed, they’re crafted. 
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Embrace Your Season</span> <br><br>
            Sometimes, the wait is preparing you for the weight of what’s coming. The current “delay” might be preserving you from stepping into something unready. It might be shaping your mindset, building your resilience, or aligning you with the right people, skills, or maturity. And when your season comes, it will all make sense. <br><br>
            So instead of resenting where you are, honor it. Be faithful with the little. Stay consistent. Learn with what you have. Keep building quietly, even if no one’s clapping yet. You’re not being left behind, you’re being prepared.
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Keep Showing Up</span> <br><br>
            You’re not behind, you’re just in process. And the process doesn’t look the same for everyone. <br><br>
            Take your eyes off the rush and put your focus on growth. Stay in your lane. Create, learn, explore. Cry if you must, but don’t quit. One day, someone will look at your life and wonder how you did it, and you’ll tell them that you trusted the timing, even when it didn’t make sense. <br><br>
            You're not late. You're right on time.
        </p> <br>
       
         <p>
            If this encouraged you, share it with someone who needs the reminder that they are not behind, they should just understand and trust their own timing.
